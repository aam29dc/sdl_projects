# shape gen (combinatorics: a optimized solution)
  includes two combinatorical functions to generate a geometric shape within a circle of set size,
  within main it iterates frome point, line, triangle, square, ... hexagon, ... octogon, ... then converges to a circle.
  One function generates lines between all points in the shape, and the other function generates the outter edges.

# rectangle
  some program that alternates colors, rect w/in rect: rapidly until it appears to converge to white, uses sounds.

# circle
  some program that intersects two points, that rotate in a circle, that project lines outward like a circle. Together which appears to create some 'beautiful' patterns: "Sacred geometry".
